# ELEC291_Project2
Remote control and metal-detecting robot source code
OH YES

## To-do list (arbitrary order)
### Remote Control:
- JDY-40 radio serial communication
- Metal proximity indicator sound
- LCD data formatting
### Robot:
- Power system
- H-bridges for both motors
- PWM for motor control
- Frequency reading from inductor coil
### Tests:
- Metal detection threshold (what range of f counts for a valid detection)
- Motor control resistances (what values of Rt and Rc do we use)
- Straight line drive test
- Square drive test
- Figure-eight drive test
### Misc:
- Get motors lubricated
- Extra features (?)
